From a comment : >The first move in the coming WWIII, where the emperors try to expand their empires militaril,y will be to wipe out any orbit with Starlink satellites. I find this highly unlikely, given Starlink is soon to reached 10k satellites and will continue to grow. Why expand 10 000 ballistic missiles to bring down one of many communications networks ? There are so many satellites in orbit that there is a pretty good chance that if even one was to be hit by something and explode in many pieces, it would crash another one and then another one until there is nothing left. The nasa is pretty scared of it, so is SpaceX. I think it's important to note that not all collisions are equally dangerous. Consider a sat on a polar orbit colliding with one on a equatorial orbit. Or two satellites on different directions.  That  is going to be spectacular. Otoh, these kind of collisions are unlikely and should be manageable by just assigning certain shells (say 5km) for every possible direction and orientation. If two Starlink satellites collide that go roughly in the same direction, it's not exactly a huge problem. I think the biggest issue is to coordinate this and potentially disallow some excentric orbits. What\u2019s the plan as the solar maximum returns? Can anyone explain how does one technically lower a satellite? 3 week old news OP? Previously:  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46457454  Won't this make running Starlink more expensive? Lower orbits > Increased atmospheric drag > More fuel expended to maintain orbit > Heavier sats due to more fuel > Increased launch cost per unit Or even: Lower orbits > Increased atmospheric drag > Quicker orbit decay > Shorter lifespan of sats > More frequent launches Forgive my Kerbal-based space knowledge here.

For one thing, I was severely traumatized as a kid, which delayed a lot of my social skills. I'm catching up but not all the way there yet. When my social battery is full, I can do pretty well, but if I'm even a little down, it's basically impossible to act normally. I also had it hammered into me as a kid that nobody wants me around, nobody could ever love me, I'm a failure, a burden, a creep, a weirdo, and nothing but a bothersome nuisance that nobody would ever want to spend 30 seconds alone with. I'm trying to reject these thoughts, but it's difficult when you have nobody to talk to. It's like pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. I wonder how many people have the same issue. I've made a few friends in person, but I rarely get to see them. Well I've started doing public surveys in my nearby big city, and documenting the results. I just hold out a posterboard that says \"how alone do you feel\"[1] or \"have you ever been in love\" etc, and hold out a marker, and people come up and take the survey.

But I have done it for enough months that some people have come up to me and told me that I've helped them, or that they look forward to my signs.

Which would be completely outdated by now anyway, as the book is from 2014, an eternity in AI. I don't think many people will want to read it today. As far as I know, mathematical theories like SLT have been of little use for the invention of transformers or for explaining why neural networks don't overfit despite large VC dimension. Edit: I think the title \"From theory to machine learning\" sums up what was wrong with this theory-first approach. Basically, people with interest in math but with no interest in software engineering got interested in ML and invented various abstract \"learning theories\", e.g. statistical learning theory (SLT). Which had very little to do with what you can do in practice. Meanwhile, engineers ignored those theories and got their hands dirty on actual neural network implementations while trying to figure out how their performance can be improved, which led to things like CNNs and later transformers.

Which would be completely outdated by now anyway, as the book is from 2014, an eternity in AI. I don't think many people will want to read it today. As far as I know, mathematical theories like SLT have been of little use for the invention of transformers or for explaining why neural networks don't overfit despite large VC dimension. Edit: I think the title \"From theory to machine learning\" sums up what was wrong with this theory-first approach. Basically, people with interest in math but with no interest in software engineering got interested in ML and invented various abstract \"learning theories\", e.g. statistical learning theory (SLT). Which had very little to do with what you can do in practice. Meanwhile, engineers ignored those theories and got their hands dirty on actual neural network implementations while trying to figure out how their performance can be improved, which led to things like CNNs and later transformers.

I'm convinced now that the key to getting useful results out of coding agents (Claude Code, Codex CLI etc) is having good mechanisms in place to help those agents exercise and validate the code they are writing. At the most basic level this means making sure they can run commands to execute the code - easiest with languages like Python, with HTML+JavaScript you need to remind them that Playwright exists and they should use it. The next step up from that is a good automated test suite. Then we get into quality of code/life improvement tools - automatic code formatters, linters, fuzzing tools etc. Debuggers are good too. These tend to be less coding-agent friendly due to them often having directly interactive interfaces, but agents can increasingly use them - and there are other options that are a better fit as well. I'd put formal verification tools like the ones mentioned by Martin on this spectrum too. They're potentially a fantastic unlock for agents - they're effectively just niche programming languages, and models are really good at even niche languages these days. If you're not finding any value in coding agents but you've also not invested in execution and automated testing environment features, that's probably why. Unless you feed a spec to the LLM, and it nitpicks compiled TLA+ output generated by your PlusCal input, gaslights you into saying the code you just ran and pasted the output of is invalid, then generates invalid TLA+ output in response.

{"anchor": "Karpathy on Programming: \u201cI've never felt this much behind\u201d. For the longest time, the joy of creation in programming came from solving hard problems. The pursuit of a challenge meant something. Now, that pursuit seems to be short-circuited by an animated being racing ahead under a different set of incentives. I see a tsunami at the beach, and I\u2019m not sure whether I can run fast enough. Being a nondeterministic tool, the output for a given input can vary. Rather than having a solid plan of, \"if I provide this input, then that will happen\", it's more like, \"if I do something like this, I can expect something like that, probably, and if not, then try again until it works, I suppose\". What are the productivity gains? Obviously, it must vary. The quality of the tool output varies based on numerous criteria, including what programming language is being used and what problem is trying to be solved. The fact that person A gets a 10x productivity increase on their project  does not  mean that person B will also get a 10x productivity increase on their project, no matter how well they use the tool. But again, tool usage itself is variable. Person A themselves might get a 10x boost one time, and 8x another time, and 4x another time, and 2x another time. Man, this is giving me a cognitive dissonance compared to my experiences. Actually, even the post itself reads like a cognitive dissonance with a dash of the usual \"if it's not working for you then you are using it wrong\" defence. > There's a new programmable layer of abstraction to master (in addition to the usual layers below) involving agents, subagents, their prompts, contexts, memory, modes, permissions, tools, plugins, skills, hooks, MCP, LSP, slash commands, workflows, IDE integrations, and a need to build an all-encompassing mental model for strengths and pitfalls of fundamentally stochastic, fallible, unintelligible and changing entities suddenly intermingled with what used to be good old fashioned engineering.

TL;DR If you want to jump straight to the conclusion, I\u2019d say go for Gemini 2.5 Pro, it\u2019s better at coding, has one million in context window as compared to Claude\u2019s 200k, and you can get it for free (a big plus). However, Claude\u2019s 3.7 Sonnet is not that far behind. Though at this point there\u2019s no point using it over Gemini 2.5 Pro. From my use case, the Gemini 2.5 is terrible. I have a complex Cython code in a single file (1500 lines) for a Sequence Labeling. Claude and o3 are very good in improving this code and following the commands. The Gemini always try to do unrelated changes. For example, I asked, separately, for small changes such as remove this unused function, or cache the arrays indexes. Every time it completely refactored the code and was obsessed with removing the gil. The output code is always broken, because removing the gil is not easy. Is there a less biased discussion? The OP link is a thinly veiled and biased advert for something called composio and really a biased and overly flowery view of Gemini 2.5 pro. Example: \u201cEveryone\u2019s talking about this model on Twitter (X) and YouTube. It\u2019s trending everywhere, like seriously. The first model from Google to receive such fanfare. And it is #1 in the LMArena just like that. But what does this mean? It means that this model is killing all the other models in coding, math, Science, Image understanding, and other areas.\u201d For Gemini: play around with the temperature: the default is terrible: we had much better results with (much) lower values. Gemini is the only model which tells me when it's a good time to stop chatting because either it can't find a solution or because it dislikes my solution (when I actively want to neglect security). And the context length is just amazing. When ChatGPT's context is full, it totally forgets what we were chatting about, as if it would start an entirely new chat.

Canadian pride isn't enough to keep a company in Canada. There are real and significant economic incentives to move elsewhere. That said, it's disappointing that YC no longer supports Canadian companies. That's truly saddening. I hope there will be more VC backing in Canada because the talent is definitely there. Wonder if the founders not being US citizens or possibly even residents will hinder their ability to maintain their company.  Or, whether this change increases the likelihood of being replaced when the startup shows some success. Also, being foreign in the US is a concern at the moment.  Hell, being native in the US is a concern at the moment... This is extremely misleading. YC still backs Canadian founders (and other international founders). There must have been one too many painful experiences investing in companies based in Canada. Creating or converting to a US-based entity is a standard ask for most international founders who want to participate YC and I suppose something has changed such that Canada is no longer an exception to that.

It's not for a job or improve a LLM or doing something useful per se, just to \"enjoy\" how version X or Y of an LLM can solve problems. I don't want to sound grumpy or but it doesn't achieve anything, this is just a showcase of how a \"calculator with a small probability of failure can succeed\". Move on, do something useful, don't stop being amazed by AI but please stop throwing it at my face. I enjoy reading Peter\u2019s \u2018Python studies\u2019 and was surprised to see here a comparison of different LLMs for solving advent of code problems, but the linked article is pretty cool. Peter and a friend of his wrote an article over a year ago discussing whether or not LLMs are already AGI, and after re-reading that article my opinion was moved a bit to: LLMs are AGI in broad digital domains. I still need to see embodied AI in robots and physical devices before I think we are 100% of the way there.

One of the reasons modern sci-fi films (e.g., Blade Runner 2049) seem so flat to me is because of the costumes. They're always too minimal and too forgettable. There's really nothing special about the fashion in that movie. Compare that to the hyper-maximalist 80s movie outfits. The original Blade Runner has more creativity in one outfit than pretty much the entirety of the sequel. I wonder why that is. My guess is that it's just a symptom of the same thing that causes everyone to stop buying colorful cars, and instead default to a grayscale one: fear that being too outlandish or creative will turn off potential customers/viewers. It reminds me of a discussion from, who was it, Quentin Tarantino? He said he was anxious going into making his first film. A seasoned Hollywood veteran told him to relax\u2014all those pros: the costume designers, the camera operators, sound, set designers, makeup, etc.\u2026 they're going to make the movie look fantastic. > Rachael's third outfit (perhaps the most famous) is a fur coat patterned in chevron stripes of different fur colours of grey and white.

I always thought it just went to show he likes dumpster diving for broken toys. Blade Runner's future still feels futuristic even today - while many sci-fi films of that era don't. I think it's largely due to the brilliant production design and cinematography. Just about every creative department over-achieved spectacularly. I saw it in 70mm when it came out it and it absolutely blew my teenaged mind. Even as a hardcore sci-fi fan, I'd never seen anything like BR's vision of an eclectic urban dystopia.

Wall calendar, marking each day I do my exercises. Stronger, leaner, fitter, healthier.  Been doing this for years.  It accumulates over time. I know it might sound cliche but walking is an easy habit to start and keep up with. I tend to walk when I get stuck on a problem and try to distract my mind with something else. Usually this turns into my subconscious working through the problem until I get an idea to try out. The health benefits are very nice too if you\u2019re just starting out. There are diminishing returns as your body gets used to it. 15 minutes in the morning/afternoon is my usually habit while at work. But on particularly tough days or just ones with nice weather I\u2019d go for much longer walks. It\u2019s nice to explore the spaces around you when on these walks. You\u2019ll end up discovering more of your surroundings than you\u2019d ever expect. One nice benefit I\u2019ve found is that I can do a 35ish minute walk to the movie theater I\u2019d normally drive to. Doing this lets me just go see a movie on a whim, eat at one of the many restaurants near it. Maybe get a little drunk and be able to walk off a meal/buzz on the way back.

China worked up the ladder of manufacturing from simple, bad stuff to highly complex things - exactly what westerners then claimed they\u2019d never be able to.\nThen as that was conquered, westerners comforted themselves by insisting that China could copy, but trail-blazing would always still be our thing.
